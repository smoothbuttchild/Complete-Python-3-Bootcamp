        "* <i>(inserted on 20/3)</i> This course focuses on improving performance (time taken) via better algorithms, even though the way you write your code may affect performance. Students should not attempt to improve performance by using multi-threading, or multi-tasking (using multiple machines to solve parts of the problem), forwarding the input to a remote server that uses a high performance language to solve or other novel ways that are not algorithm-related. Do clarify with your faculty or Senior TA if in doubt.\n",

You are allowed to use these libraries (just insert the correct `import` statement), but do not install (`!pip install`) any other 3rd party libraries in collab even if you know how to. Your solution must work in standard collab. We won't be installing any special 3rd party libraries for you when marking.\n",

        "## (8) Context\n",
        "A social network platform wants to recommend some users who are not yet friends to become friends, as a campaign to boost community connection and activity level. Research on social networks has yielded the following general observations:\n",
        "\n",
        "<ol>\n",
        "<li> It is found that a user is more likely to accept a friend recommendation if he and the recommended friend have a large number of common friends.\n",
        "<li> In general, a user is more likely to accept a friend recommendation if the recommended friend is more selective in making friends. A user is deemed more selective if he has fewer friends.\n",
        "<li> In a social network, some users are indiscriminate when befriending others and therefore have an excessively large number of friends. These are considered non-selective users.\n",
        "</ol>\n",
        "We have come up with a model which incorparates the above observations into a quantitative measure called the S score (S stands for \"strength\"). S is a quantitative measure of the strength of a potential link between two users in a social network.\n",

        "- users 1, 2 and 3 are common friends of $u$ and $v$. We are showing only 3 common friends here. If $u$ and $v$ have $n$ common friends, there will be $n$ terms in the equation.\n",
        "\n",
        "This measure takes into consideration of the number of common friends of $u$ and $v$ -- the more common friends they have, the greater the measure (Observation 1) -- and the selectiveness of each common friend $w$ -- the $\\log()$ scales down the number of friends of $w$ and the reciprocal for the log number of friends of $w$ makes it such that the less selective $w$ is in making friends, the less $w$ would weigh in the counting of the common friends between $u$ and $v$ (Observations 2 and 3).\n",
        "\n",
        "For this project, a social network is modeled as a undirected graph: each vertex is a user, and each edge represents a mutual friendship in this social network. Friendships must be mutual (i.e. is $u$ is a friend of $v$, $v$ will definitely be a friend of $u$). Users who are not friends will not be directly connected via an edge.\n",
